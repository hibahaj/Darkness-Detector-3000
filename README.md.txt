Project Description
The Darkness Intensity Measurement Web App is a whimsically pointless tool designed to measure how dark it really is in a dark room. By allowing users to upload images taken in low-light conditions, this app serves absolutely no practical purpose—because, let's face it, if you’re in a dark room, you already know it’s dark! 


The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world where darkness reigns supreme in corners and closets, how can one accurately gauge just how dark it is? Is it just slightly dim, or are you entering the realm of pitch-black? Enter the absurd struggle of measuring darkness—because who needs practical solutions when you can measure nothingness?


The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the "Useless Darkness Intensity Measurement Web App"! Simply upload a photo taken in complete darkness and receive a highly scientific darkness rating. Your friends will be utterly amazed by the sheer futility of this app, while you bask in the glory of measuring the unmeasurable. Finally, you can quantify the shadowy ambiance of your life with flair!
